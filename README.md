### Random thoughts
This was a very interesting exercise, text editors are full of quirks and design choices.
This is obviously a very minimal implementation.  If I were to spend more time on this, 
there are obviously many additions I would make.  A list would look something like this:
- tests, tests, tests. testing terminal input will require further research 
- support for file paths instead of file name and creating new files
- better keybindings and options to change keybindings
- some kind of status line to indicate file name, line number, etc
- continued refactoring of main classes.
